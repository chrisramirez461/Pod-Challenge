        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Dr. Stephen Strange, M.D. a.k.a. Doctor Strange, was the Sorcerer Supreme for Earth-616. 
            Strange was once a brilliant but arrogant neurosurgeon, until a car accident crippled his hands.
            When modern medicine failed him, he embarked on a journey to Kamar-Taj in Tibet, 
            where he was trained by the Ancient One. He healed his hands and learned more about Magic, 
            eventually becoming a Master of the Mystic Arts. He settled in the Sanctum Sanctorum in 
            Greenwich Village, New York City, becoming the Earth's protector from any mystical threats.</p>

        <h2>Strange's Powers</h2>
        <p>Dr. Strange possesses a vast mastery of the mystic arts; his primary magical patrons are a group 
            of entities known as "the Vishanti." The Vishanti are a trinity of godly beings comprised of 
            Agamotto, Hoggoth, and Oshtur. Although he has, on rare occasions, called upon the power of 
            demons such as Dormammu; Strange more frequently did so before he realized Dormammu's true dark 
            nature in the earlier issues. He has once stated that he can kill a mortal with the mere twitch 
            of a finger.</p>
